# Installing the channel on your Roku

### Step One: Enable Developer Mode
Head to your living room, then turn the Roku on. Enabling developer mode starts by pressing a particular sequence of buttons on the official Roku remote (not the remote app on your phone.) In order, press:

Home three times

Up two times

Right once

Left once

Right once

Left once

Right once.

Do all that and you should see the Developer Sceen.


Write down the IP address and the username seen here, because you’re going to need them later. Once you’ve got that information, select “Enable installer and restart,” then hit “OK” on your remote. You’ll be asked if you agree with the SKD License Agreement:

Click I Agree, then you’ll be asked to pick a development webserver password.



Take note of the password you set, ideally in the same place you took note of your IP address and username earlier. Your Roku will now restart. Once it’s booted, you can access Developer Mode.

### Step Two: Access Developer Mode
On a computer connected to the same network as your Roku, open your web browser. Paste the IP address you wrote down earlier in the URL bar, then hit Enter, and you’ll be asked for your username and password.


Enter them, then click “Log in,” and your browser will open developer mode.

### Step Three: Upload Your App to the Roku
Your browser has now opened the Development Application installer.

Click the “Upload” button, then point your browser toward your ZIP file.



The file name should be beside the “Upload” button.



Click “Install” and the installation process will begin. When its done, your app will instantly open on the Roku.

# Using this repository 

This channel basically has all the features a typical user would need- so the idea is all an end user (e.g you, the reader) need to do is modify the feed url to populate the channel.
